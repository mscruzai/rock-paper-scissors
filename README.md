Odin Project: Rock Paper Scissors Foundations Course

We’re going to make an implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”. If you don’t know what that is check the Wikipedia article or this detailed step-by-step. For the moment we’re just going to play the game from the browser console, but we will revisit this project in a later lesson and add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text, so don’t forget to keep the code on GitHub! You might notice some ‘Live Preview’ links in the student solutions that have a GUI - this is coming in a later lesson. When you get there don’t forget to come back and add your link!

For this exercise the output is in the console log.

Open up the browser’s console by right-clicking on the blank webpage and selecting “Inspect” or “Inspect Element”.

In the ‘Developer Tools’ pane find and select the ‘Console’ tab, where you should see the output of our console.log statements.

Then refresh the browser to restart the game.
